# AI Prompt Logging

## üìù AI Usage Summary
- **Did AI help you solve any problems? If so, how?**
Yes, AI significantly enhanced my problem-solving process by:
1. Providing deep technical insights into complex architectural decisions
2. Suggesting optimized code patterns and best practices
3. Identifying potential edge cases and security considerations
4. Offering alternative approaches to consider
5. Helping validate technical decisions against industry standards

- **What parts were 100% human-driven?**
1. Critical architectural decisions and trade-off analysis
2. Code review and quality assurance
3. Security considerations and risk assessment
4. Performance optimization decisions
5. Integration testing strategy
6. Git workflow and version control management

- **Did AI generate incorrect/misleading answers? How did you correct them?**
Yes, in a few instances:
1. Initial test cases were incomplete - I refined the prompt to request more comprehensive test coverage
2. Some security implementations needed hardening - I asked for additional security measures
3. Performance optimizations needed tuning - I requested specific benchmarks and metrics
4. Error handling was insufficient - I prompted for more robust error management

- **Which AI-powered IDE tools did you use?**
1. Cursor AI IDE - For code generation and refactoring
2. Claude - For architectural decisions and technical guidance
