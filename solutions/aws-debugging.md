# AWS Aurora PostgreSQL Upgrade Debugging

## Problem Statement
After upgrading Aurora Serverless Postgres from v13 to v14, the cluster fails with:
```
ERROR: Extension incompatible: some_extension v1.3 not compatible with Postgres v14
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue is a version incompatibility between the extension (`some_extension`) and PostgreSQL v14. This is a common issue during major version upgrades because:

1. **Extension API Changes**: PostgreSQL major versions often change extension APIs
2. **Compiled C Extensions**: Some extensions have binary components that need to be recompiled
3. **Version Restrictions**: Extensions may explicitly restrict which PostgreSQL versions they support

## Debugging Process

### Step 1: Identify All Installed Extensions
First, we need to identify all extensions installed in the database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_extension;
```

This will list all installed extensions, their versions, and schemas.

### Step 2: Check Extension Compatibility with PostgreSQL 14
For each extension, verify compatibility with PostgreSQL 14:
- Check the official documentation for each extension
- Look for specific version compatibility matrices
- Check AWS documentation for Aurora-specific extensions

### Step 3: Check for Extension Updates
For each incompatible extension:
- Check if a compatible version exists
- Research if AWS has provided compatible alternatives

### Step 4: Review Aurora Upgrade Documentation
Review AWS's documentation for Aurora PostgreSQL upgrade paths:
- Check which extensions are automatically upgraded
- Look for known incompatibilities
- Review the recommended pre-upgrade assessment process

### Step 5: Analyze Logs for Additional Context
Examine detailed logs to get more context about the failure:
- Check Aurora logs in CloudWatch
- Look for any additional errors related to the extension
- Check for sequence of events during the upgrade process

## Solution Strategy with Minimal Downtime

### Approach 1: Create a Read Replica with Modified Extensions
1. Create a read replica of the v13 cluster
2. Remove or update incompatible extensions on the replica
3. Attempt upgrade on the replica first
4. If successful, plan to switch to the upgraded replica

### Approach 2: Extension Modification Before Upgrade
1. Identify if `some_extension` is critical for application functionality
2. If not critical, drop the extension before upgrading:
   ```sql
   DROP EXTENSION some_extension;
   ```
3. Perform the upgrade to PostgreSQL 14
4. Install a compatible version after the upgrade if needed:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION some_extension VERSION '2.0';
   ```

### Approach 3: Staged Migration with Blue/Green Deployment
For minimal downtime:
1. Create a new PostgreSQL 14 Aurora cluster
2. Set up logical replication from v13 to v14 (excluding incompatible extensions)
3. Develop application-level workarounds for the missing extension functionality
4. Test thoroughly with production data
5. Use a DNS switch or load balancer to cut over with minimal downtime

### Approach 4: Contact AWS Support
If the extension is critical and has no available compatible version:
1. Open a support case with AWS
2. Request guidance on compatible alternatives
3. Consider a custom extension implementation if necessary

## Implementation Plan for Minimal Downtime

### Assessment Phase (0 hours downtime)
- Run compatibility assessment tools
- Identify all potentially incompatible extensions
- Create a test cluster for validation

### Preparation Phase (0 hours downtime)
- Create database snapshot of production
- Test upgrade process in a staging environment
- Document exact steps and fallback procedures
- Update application code if needed to handle extension changes

### Execution Phase (15-30 minutes downtime)
- Schedule a maintenance window
- Create a final snapshot before upgrading
- Execute the chosen strategy
- Verify application functionality

### Verification Phase (0 hours downtime)
- Monitor system performance
- Run validation tests
- Check application logs for errors

## Fallback Plan
- If issues are encountered, restore from the final snapshot
- Switch back to the original cluster configuration

## Long-Term Recommendations
1. Include extension compatibility in future upgrade planning
2. Maintain a test environment that mirrors production
3. Develop a comprehensive extension management strategy
4. Consider using extension-agnostic designs where possible
5. Set up a regular review process for extension versions and compatibility
